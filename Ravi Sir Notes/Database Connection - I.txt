
* In any databases, there are 3 main steps:
	step 1: connect to DB
	step 2: fire the query
	step 3: close database connection

* In different languages, the numbers of statements varies.
But above 3 steps are mandatory.
	For example:
	In Java, we need 5 statements
	In C#, VB.net we need 4 statements

* Here in Python, we have 3 statements to perform DB 
operations.

* In Python, we can connect with any database, but 
SQLite3 is Python's local database (in-house database). 
For it we don't require any additional drivers to 
download.

* We have package "sqlite3" to be imported.

* In Python,
	step 1: connect to Database by using connect().
		This function returns an object of 
		class Connection. This object can be used 
		to perform further database operations.
		(similar to 'fobj' that we used in Files)
	step 2: Directly fire query, by using execute() 
		method.
	step 3: commit the query by using commit() 
	step 4: close the connection.

* In Java, auto-commit option is by-default true. Therefore 
a query directly gets affected. No need to apply commit.

* In Python, auto-commit option is by-default false. 
Therefore it is mandatory to commit the query by using 
commit().

For example:
-------------
import sqlite3

nm = input("Enter employee Name : ")
post = input("Enter Post : ")
dep = input("Enter Department : ")
sal = input("Enter Salary : ")

query = "insert into emp_info values ('" + nm + "', '" + post + "', '" + dep + "', '" + sal + "')"
con = sqlite3.connect("student_db.db")
con.execute(query)
con.commit()
con.close()
print("Data Saved...")
